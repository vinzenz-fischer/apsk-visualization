A visualization of amplitude and phase-shift modulation using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

The inspiration for this project was an NDC Keynote bz Dylan Beattie:
[Apps, Algorithms and Abstractions: Decoding our Digital World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPS-eFmdepw&t=996s)

## What is an amplitude and phase-shift modulation?
It's a cool technique to fit many bits of information into a single wavelength.
