# Notes

## ToDos
- get a basic version working ✔
- use `push();` `translate();` `pop();` instead ✔
- fix initial weird stuff ✔(hacky workaround)
- highlight where symbols start and end ✔
- label symbols ✔
- modulation degree slider
    - adaptive `scale`
    - only show label of active constellation point (when mod_deg too big)
- slow-mo slider


## Ideas
- use a spring to imitate real world inaccuracy and inertia
- receiver
- statistics about noise resistance, data throughput, how hard it is to differentiate similar symbols
- ability to change the constellation pattern (quadrature, radial, hexagonal?)
