# Notes

## ToDos
- get a basic version working ✔
- use `push();` `translate();` `pop();` instead ✔
- fix initial weird stuff ✔(hacky workaround)
- highlight where symbols start and end ✔
- label symbols ✔
- modulation degree slider
    - adaptive `scale`
    - only show label of active constellation point (when mod_deg too big)


## Ideas
- data string moving along with the samples
- slow-mo slider
- receiver
- statistics about noise resistance, data throughput, how hard it is to differentiate similar data points
- ability to change the data point pattern (quadrature, radial)
- use a spring to imitate real world inaccuracy and inertia
- send actual data (and see how well/fast it gets transmitted)
