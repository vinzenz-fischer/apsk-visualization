# Notes

## ToDos
- use `push();` `translate();` `pop();`
- fix initial weird stuff
- adaptive `scale`


## Ideas
- data string moving along with the samples
- modulation degree slider
- slow-mo slider
- receiver
- statistics about noise resistance, data throughput, how hard it is to differentiate similar data points
- ability to change the data point pattern (quadrature, radial)
- use a spring to imitate real world inaccuracy and inertia
- send actual data (and see how well/fast it gets transmitted)
